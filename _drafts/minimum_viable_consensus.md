title: Miminum viable consensus

Consensus is valued, but consensus for consensus-sake shouldn't be.

What does it mean for consensus to be viable, 
and how can you reach it when parties are polarized?

When building a software product, 
it's always a good idea to build as little as possible 
and get it in front of users as soon as possible.

The trick is in understanding that the phrase "as little as possible"
is short for "enough features for the tool to 
do something that the user needs done 
in a manner that the user will find useful".

There's a term for this that Product Manager's use:
Minimum Viable Product, and viable is the key.
The product can't be dead-on-arrival
and it has to survive (at least until your next release).
