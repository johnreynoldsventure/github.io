title: Summarizing discussions
---

Discussions produce a lot of information, some of which is usefull and some of which is useless and most of which lies somewhere between those two extremes.

It is useful to record everyones comments so that you can go back and ensure what was said, but a raw stream of comments isn't very helpful when you're trying to communicate or remember the outcome of the discussion.

For communication and rememberance, concise and accurate summaries are priceless.

Someone asked a question. Answers were proposed. Clarifications were requested and given. All very important if you need to know how an outcome was reached, but tedious and error prone for understanding the outcome.

Each Question and its answers should be distilled into clear statements.

A good approach is to identify the accepted answers and rework them into self-standing statements. If information from the question is key to understanding the statement, then include that too.

Question: Where do you want to eat today?

Summary: I want to eat at Frankie's today.
