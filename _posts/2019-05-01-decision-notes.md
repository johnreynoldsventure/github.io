I find that taking notes helps me reach better decisions.
Notes help me organize my thoughts,
and they are particularly important when I'm trying to make (or sell) a decision with others.

When making decisions with someone else,
my notes help me to present my ideas better
and to develop a better understanding of their ideas.

While I find that any notes are better than no notes, I recommend structuring your notes.

It may seem like a waste of time, but start by "stating the obvious".
Why are you making a decision?
What's the challenge that you're trying to address?
Is it an opportunity or is it a problem?

What benefits to you hope to gain by making a decision?
What's the down-side if you don't decide?

Here's an example:

# Should we buy a condo in El Paso?

## Why would we do this?

###To reduce our housing expenses.

&nbsp;&nbsp;How much would expenses be reduced?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Current housing cost

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mortgage

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxes

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HOA fees

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Projected housing cost

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mortgage

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxes

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HOA fees

###To be closer to family.

###To reduce maintenance.

&nbsp;&nbsp;How would maintenance be reduced?

## Why would we not do this?

###We'd miss many of the things that we like to do in Santa Fe.

&nbsp;&nbsp;What things would we miss?

&nbsp;&nbsp;What alternate things are there to do in El Paso?
